Mount -> Constuctor/Props (We must not make a constructor 
            which is default me must make it with Props) 
      -> State getDerivedStateFromProps(Props,State)
      -> Render (This Component will render in the virtual getDerivedStateFromProps)
      -> ComponentDidMount() - The components you've directed to create ComponentDidMount says its done and 
                               reflected to the virtual ComponentDidMount


Updating -> getDerivedStateFromProps -> ShouldComponentUpdate (If it will return true then the changes will  -> getSnapShotBeforeUpdate (In this a screenshot will be there of the last values and then it will be changed) -> componentDidUpdate
                                       be made in the virtual DOM)

UnMount -> ComponentWillUnMount

Error Handling -> getDerivedStateFromError -> ComponentDidCatch
